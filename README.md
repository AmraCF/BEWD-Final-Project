For my final project I will be creating a social media platform for bloggers. The social media will consist of post templete, users profiles, and home page. Users will be able to share stories from their blog and connect the images to their blog sites. They will also be able to use hash tags and user search button to find other users with similar interests. Some special features that I would like to add include in article advertising and advertising on the profile page. I would also like to include a wishlist button where users can search and display items they would love to have.
